 #D-PorCCA
  D-PorCCA is a standalone desktop application with the goal of providing researchers with summary data for the 
   monitoring of harbour porpoises.  
   D = Detector
   PorCC = Porpoise Click Classifier
   A = Application

#### Detector
D-PorCCA includes a detector for impulsive sounds, regularly called "click detector" and it is an adaptation of 
PAMGuard's Click Detector Module (translated by Clea Parcerisas), which uses a trigger filter to select potential
porpoise clicks (i.e., high energy content between 100 and 150 kHz)

#### PorCC: 
The porpoise click classifier (PorCC) in D-PorCCA was developed by Cosentino et al and separates clicks into either of 
three categories: high-frequency noise, high-quality porpoise click, low-quality porpoise click. More information can be 
found here:

PorCC is implemented via the package pyporcc, developed by Clea Parcerisas.

## Note
DPorCCA is still under development


 ## FILES INFORMATION 
- click_trains.py: functions to identify, clean and classify click trains
- isoutlier.py: identifies outliers in the data - function translated from Matlab by Clea Parcerisas
- sunrise.py: estimates sunset and sunrise times for a given location on a given day (GMT) from latitude and longitude
- create_settings_file.py: generates setting files when using the Detector and PorCC.
- GUIDPorCCA.py: main script where the app is created

- requirements.txt: list of packages needed for the proper functioning of D-PorCCA. During installation, the packages 
listed in this file are installed automatically.
