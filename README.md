 #D-PorCCA
  D-PorCCA is a standalone desktop application with the goal to provide researchers with summary data to monitor harbour
   porpoises from continuous recordings.  
   D = Detector
   PorCC = Porpoise Click Classifier 
   A = Application

In DPorCCA it is implemented via de package PyPorCC developed by Clea Parcerisas

The PyPorCC package also provides an adapted alternative to PAMGuard's click detector that using a filter and a trigger 
function selects clips that can potentially be clicks (high enery in the right frequency band)

## Note
This application is still under development


 ## INFORMATION ABOUT PYTHON FILES
- click_trains.py: a series of functions to identify and classify click trains
- isoutlier.py: identifies outliers in the data - from Matlab
- sunrise.py: estimates sunset and sunrise times for a given location in a given day
- create_settings_file.py: generates setting files when using the Detector and PorCC.

### Examples:


## Outputs
