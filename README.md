 #D-PorCCA
  D-PorCCA is a standalone desktop application aiming at providing researchers with summary data to monitor harbour
   porpoises from continuous recordings.  
   D = Detector
   PorCC = Porpoise Click Classifier
   A = Application

#### Detector
The Detector is an adaptation of PAMGuard's Click Detector Module (translated by Clea Parcerisas) that uses a trigger filter selecting clips that can 
potentially be porpoise clicks (i.e., high energy content between 100 and 150 kHz)

#### PorCC:

In DPorCCA, PorCC is implemented via de package pyporcc, developed by Clea Parcerisas

## Note
DPorCCA is still under development


 ## INFORMATION ABOUT PYTHON FILES
- click_trains.py: a series of functions to identify and classify click trains
- isoutlier.py: identifies outliers in the data - translated from Matlab by Clea Parcerisas
- sunrise.py: estimates sunset and sunrise times for a given location in a given day (GMT) from latitude and longitude
- create_settings_file.py: generates setting files when using the Detector and PorCC.

### Examples:
